# leaflet-challenge

To run the map visualizaiton, pull this directory and open the 'index.html' file in any browser -- I have found chrome works best for debugging but it runs fine on any browser.

I looked at the following in-class assignments for code inspiration:
--Stu_GeoJSON
--Stu_CitiBike_Leaflet

I also had help proofreading from ChatOpenAI.
